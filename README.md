# Beaver-Vault

A distributed key-value store written in Go.

## Why Beaver-Vault?

Just as beavers are nature's master builders and resource managers, Beaver-Vault is designed to be a reliable and industrious distributed storage system. Like how beavers construct intricate dams to create secure pools for storing resources, Beaver-Vault builds a robust network of nodes to safely store and manage your data. And just as beaver colonies work together to maintain their complex structures, our distributed system coordinates across multiple nodes to ensure your data is always available and protected.

Plus, beavers are pretty dam good at what they do - and so are we! ğŸ¦«
