# Beaver-Vault 🦫

A distributed key-value store written in Go that's as reliable as a beaver's dam!

## Why Beaver-Vault? 🏗️

Just like how beavers are nature's master builders and resource managers, Beaver-Vault is designed to be a reliable and industrious distributed storage system. Think of it as a digital beaver colony where:

- 🏠 Each node is like a beaver lodge in the colony
- 🌊 Data flows like water through the dam
- 🦫 Leader node is like the colony's chief beaver
- 🔄 Replication is like multiple beavers working together
- 🛡️ Fault tolerance is like having backup dams

And just as beavers are pretty dam good at what they do - so are we! 

## Quick Start 🚀

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make build
